Hi!

This is Millenial Money's (Team 12's) project for the NGI Hackathon sponsored by RBC.
We ended up placing first with this! :D

We're striving to increase financial literacy in Canadian youth through creating experiences tailored for students.

Our goals are to help late-high school/univsersity students  educate themselves QUICKLY and EFFICENTLY!

In just 12 hours, we created...

- A game to help students realize the true cost of university.

- A chatbot for students to ask financial questions to (He's judgement-free!)

- And a website to link these two things together so that the information is at the tip of people's fingers!

Play our game!
